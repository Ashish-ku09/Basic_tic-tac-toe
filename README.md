<h2>Project 1: Basic Calculator</h2>
<p>
Basic Calculator is a command-line Python application that performs essential arithmetic operations with robust error handling and continuous operation until the user chooses to exit. Built as a foundational programming exercise demonstrating Python control structures and input validation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> This project practices core Python concepts including infinite loops (while True), conditional statements (if/elif/else), string manipulation, type conversion (float()), exception prevention, and user experience design. It serves as a portfolio piece showcasing practical programming skills for a Data Science student transitioning from BSC Computer Science.
</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Five Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulo (%)</li>
    <li>Continuous Mode: Runs in a loop until user types "exit"</li>
    <li>Input Validation: Checks for numeric values (supports decimals via .replace('.', '', 1).isdigit())</li>
    <li>Zero Division Protection: Prevents crashes for / and % operations</li>
    <li>User-Friendly: Clear prompts, emoji feedback (✅❌👋), formatted results</li>
    <li>Flexible Exit: Exit from any input field (num1, num2, or operator)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2>
<p>
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic 3x3 console game for two players (X vs O) featuring interactive board display, move validation, and complete win/tie detection. Created as a practice project to master 2D arrays, game logic, and user interaction in Python.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> Demonstrates advanced Python skills including 2D list manipulation, function modularization, input parsing (split(',')), win condition algorithms (rows/columns/diagonals), and game state management. Perfect GitHub portfolio project showing structured code organization for a Data Science learner.
</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Visual Board: Numbered 3x3 grid with clear separators</li>
    <li>Easy Input: Simple row,col format (e.g., 1,2)</li>
    <li>Move Validation: Prevents invalid positions and occupied cells</li>
    <li>Win Detection: Checks all rows, columns, and both diagonals</li>
    <li>Tie Handling: Detects full board without winner</li>
    <li>Turn Management: Automatic X/O player switching</li>
</ul>

<p>Both projects use only Python 3.6+ standard library with no external dependencies.</p>
